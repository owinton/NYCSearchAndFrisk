Link to webpage https://nycsearchandfrisk.webflow.io

In case the hosting of the webpage stops working (I am using a free account, and am out of reach during the weeks up to the handin of the project), I have uploaded a PDF-version of the webpage as a backup solution. In that document the webpage functionality is not usable, and all animations and the interactive panes are thus gone.
